# dvs_msgs
===

This ROS message package was extracted from the
[rpg_dvs_ros repository UTH Zuerich's Robotics and Perception Group]
(https://github.com/uzh-rpg/rpg_dvs_ros) and as such inherits the
MIT license from its parent repository.

This package will compile into ROS1 under ``catkin build`` or ROS2
using ``colcon build``, provided the environment variable
``ROS_VERSION`` is set correctly.
